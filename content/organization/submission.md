To be considered for invitation, you must send a first draft of a position paper
to Jonathan Anderson
([jonathan.anderson@mun.ca](mailto:jonathan.anderson@mun.ca?subject=SPW2016))
by the published deadline.
Short indicative submissions are preferred, preferably no more than 2000 words.
You will have the opportunity to extend and revise your paper both before the
pre-proceedings are issued, and after the workshop.
At the workshop, you will be expected to spend ten minutes introducing the idea
of your paper.
This will be followed by a longer discussion.

Please also refer to the
[Ground Rules]({{% relref "ground-rules.md" %}}) and
[Important Dates]({{% relref "dates.md" %}})
for further information.

The proceedings of previous workshops in this series have been published by
Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (see LNCS 8809, 8263, 7622,
7114, 7028, 6615, 5964, 5087, 4631, 3957, 3364, 2845, 2467, 2133, 1796, 1550,
1361 and 1189).
If you have not previously attended the Security Protocols Workshop, you may
find it helpful to refer to these to get an idea of the flavour.

If your paper has been accepted and you wish to revise it before the workshop,
you may do so. However, please note the absolute and hard deadline for receiving
any such revision.

There are no stipulations as to how position papers should be formatted for the
pre-proceedings; anything that fits onto A4 will do. You will have the
opportunity to revise your paper after the workshop for the final proceedings.
However, you will need prepare your final (revised) paper in LaTeX using
llncs.cls according to the Springer-Verlag Guidelines for Publication. This is a
single column format. Final submissions MUST be in LaTeX form. You will also be
required to complete a Springer copyright form.

There is no page limit, but short submissions are encouraged, especially for
position papers to appear in the pre-proceedings. In the final publication form
in the Springer LNCS series, we believe the longest paper in recent years was
under 15 pages.
