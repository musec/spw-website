* There must be a presenter for each position paper.
* No two position papers can have the same presenter.
* The presenter must pay the registration fee.
* A presenter can bring a PhD student free (subject to prior notification), but
  part of the task of the presenter is to lead a discussion about the
  implications and wider context of the ideas, so we generally expect the person
  paying the registration fee to take the lead (and the PhD student to
  participate and contribute).
* There is limited opportunity for additional participants who are not
  presenters (e.g. coauthors) to register, or for a presenter to bring a second
  free PhD student. Contact us early on if you might want to do either of these.
* PhD students attend the workshop only.
* Yes, you can bring your PhD student as a dinner guest.
* There are separate rules for computer lab or UH PhD students.
* We expect presenters to attend for the whole workshop - you can’t build your
  discussion on what has already happened if you weren’t there.
* Presenters are expected to present in the allocated slot. We choose the
  running order and groupings carefully, the talks are cumulative and do not
  commute.
