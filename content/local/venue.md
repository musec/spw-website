Approximately every ten years, SPW is *not* held in Cambridge.
This year, the workshop will be hosted in Brno, Czech Republic,
at another previously-monastic institution: the
[Mendel Museum of Masaryk University](http://mendelmuseum.muni.cz/en/).
This museum is on the site of the Augustinian abbey where Gregor Mendel
conducted his seminal — though ignored for many years — genetics work.
