We are pleased to announce the
twenty-fourth International Workshop on Security Protocols,
to be held at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.

## Theme

In keeping with this year's location
— Brno is where Gregor Mendel presented his seminal
*Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden* (Experiments on Plant Hybridization) —
our theme is "Evolving Security".

Security protocols evolve: security requirements evolve, and so do security
mechanisms.
Just to keep things fair, attackers have been evolving their agenda and
capabilities as well.
And, of course, there are the protocols that refuse to evolve, despite selection
pressure to do so: what are they, and when will they go extinct?

Evolution itself is also a potential source of conceptual inspiration for
designing new security processes and models.
Is our password-shaped appendix still useful?
Does natural selection really apply to all security protocols, or only in some
contexts?
To what extent are security properties epigenetic?
What does security "fitness" even mean?

**Note:**
this theme is not intended to restrict the topic of your paper, but to help
provide a particular perspective and focus to the discussions.
Our intention is to stimulate discussion likely to lead to conceptual advances,
or to promising new lines of investigation, rather than to consider
finished work.
